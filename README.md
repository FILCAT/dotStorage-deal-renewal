[NFT.Storage](http://nft.storage/) has launched the NFT Forever Project to show the world that the new Filecoin Virtual Machine can guarantee trustless, perpetual storage for NFT images and metadata via smart contracts. These Filecoin storage agreements can be automatically renewed via smart contract. Renewals are programmatic and cryptographically proven. This is the first, and most important step towards enabling perpetual storage for NFTs.

[NFT.Storage](http://NFT.Storage) offers a future-proof method of preserving off-chain NFT data. Today, NFT.Storage makes over 115 million NFT assets available in the Filecoin decentralized storage network. NFT.Storage also makes the data available over IPFS, which uses a system of hash-based content identifiers called CIDs that are like unique fingerprints. Each CID is immutable and points to a specific piece of content, meaning that an NFTâ€™s associated content can be easily verified, trusted, and retrieved.

Perpetual storage is important to the [NFT.Storage](http://NFT.Storage) mission of preserving all NFT data as a public good, like the Wayback Machine did for web pages. Initially, the NFT Forever Project will provide straightforward deal renewals. In the future, data monitoring and integrity features will be added until NFT.Storage offers a complete trustless, perpetual storage solution.

NFT creators can use NFT.Storage for free through a no-code web interface, a simple API, or integrations with popular NFT platforms such as Rarible, Metaplex Creator Studio, OpenSea, and more.
